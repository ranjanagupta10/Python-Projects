Python with version 3.x
install following libraries:
	tkinter
	pygame
	random

These codes are required to run the sound in the game as it fetches mixer in pygame.
py.mixer.pre_init(44100,16,2,4096)

User would need to change the location in codes for images and sounds depending on
where the game is saved.

Thanks & Enjoy!!!
